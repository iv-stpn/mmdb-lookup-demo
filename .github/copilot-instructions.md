This is a React TypeScript Vite project for visualizing MMDB (MaxMind Database) files. The application:

- Allows users to select from different MMDB datasets (ASN, City, Country)
- Processes MMDB files
- Provides IP address lookup functionality
- Visualizes geographic and network data

Key technologies:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- MaxMind library for MMDB file processing
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons

When working on this project:
- Use TypeScript types for all data structures
- Handle asynchronous MMDB file loading properly
- Implement proper error handling for network requests and file processing
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Ensure responsive design for the visualization components
